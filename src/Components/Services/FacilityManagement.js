                the access and egress to a facility or area. The purpose of

                personnel, vehicles, and materials are allowed to enter, move
                within, and leave the facility. This provides the protection for

                Security Officers, by their presence and professional
                performance of duties, will discourage, detect, and detain
                potential violators. People associated with criminals/criminal
                activity tend to avoid facilities and/or areas where there are
                professional Security Officers on site.
