                Our classrooms must be safe places for teaching and learning,
                but reports still warn us that schools can be the site for
                certain particularly unsafe incidents. Schools have to be
                prepared to address a range of threats to security at schools,
                such as weather, lock-in, bullying, and violent attacks.
