              <h3 className="text-primary">Staff Screening & Selection</h3>
              <p>
                When screening and selecting staff, CBSS Security requires
                applicants to submit a full resume with references and copies of
                qualifications. We conduct all relevant background checks and
                carry out one-on-one interviews with suitable applicants. Our
                security guards are selected on the basis of their previous
                security experience, qualifications and the qualities required
                becoming part of the CBSS Security team.
              </p>
              <h3 className="text-primary">Professional Qualification</h3>

                CBSS Security only selects security guards who are qualified,
                physically & mentally fit . This ensures all our personnel are
                qualified to cater for all relevant security situations
              </p>
              <h4 className="text-primary">Professional Qualities</h4>
              <p>
                One of the essential professional qualities of any CBSS Security
                guard is to be an excellent communicator. We believe
                communication is at the forefront of providing for and meeting
                our individual clientsâ€™ needs and for attending to and reporting
                all matters of security. In addition CBSS Security seeks
                employees that are astute observers and who are responsible and
                keen to take initiative.
              </p>
              <h3 className="text-primary">Induction & Orientation </h3>
              <p>
                CBSS Security management takes an active role in the initial
                induction of new employees and in their early months of
                employment through a systematic orientation process. New
                employees receive a full induction into all company procedures
                including the use of Daily Occurrence Books, Incident Reports,
                Site Operation Procedures and Baton Point Monitoring.
              </p>
              <p>
                We imbue all new staff with the company values of
                responsibility, initiative and proactively for securing client
                assets and personnel. In order to carry out a thorough process
                of orientation, our Operations Managers make frequent visits to
                new employees in their first months on the job and then make
                contact at least weekly to ensure they are on track.
